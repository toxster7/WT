    "In this exercise you will train and evaluate a decision tree. Opposed to the previous exercises with the topics _univariate linear regression_, _multivariate linear regression_, _logistic regression_ and _bias variance tradeoff_, you will not implement the algorithms from scratch using numpy. Instead you will use two python packages written on top of numpy, namely the _pandas_ and the _scikit-learn_ package, which are both widely used by the machine learning community. The steps can be broken down into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data from a _csv file_ into a pandas DataFrame object\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data\n",
    "3. Train a decision tree and visualize it.\n",
    "4. Do hyperparameter optimization by dividing the dataset into a fixed training set and a fixed validation set.\n",
    "5. Do hyperparameter optimization by crossvalidation\n",
    "6. Do hyperparameter optimization by gridsearch\n",

You employed two popular APIs, scikit-learn and pandas. You also calculated entropy and information gain, measures that are widely applicable in a host of statistics tasks."
